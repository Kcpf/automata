Automata is a repository (made for fun) that implements a software version of old and historic machines.

# 👨‍💻 About me and automata
I am currently a Brazilian student of computer engineering at Insper (São Paulo). This project started in the winter holidays of 2020 with the main purpose of entertainment and learning about the technologies of the past that led us to the computing power of today.
